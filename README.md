## Introduction
ChosunTruck is an autonomous driving solution for [Euro Truck Simulator 2](https://eurotrucksimulator2.com/).
Recently, autonomous driving technology has become a big issue and we have studied the technology related to this.
It is being developed in a simulator environment called Euro Truck Simulator 2 to study it with vehicles.
Because this simulator provides a good test environment that is similar to the real road, we chose it.

## Features
* You can drive a vehicle without handling it yourself.
* You can understand the principle of autonomous driving.
* (Experimental) You can detect where other vehicles are.

## How To Run It
### Windows
OS: Windows 7 64bits

IDE: Visual Studio 2015

OpenCV version: 3.0

** **NOTICE: Because mouse and keyboard input DOES NOT work on Windows, this is only available for lane detection. For more informations, see also [#4](https://github.com/bethesirius/ChosunTruck/issues/4)**

- Open the visual studio project and build it. 
- Run ETS2 in windowed mode and set resolution to 1024 * 768.(It will work properly with 1920 * 1080 screen resolution and 1024 * 768 window mode ETS2.)

### Linux
OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

#### Dependencies
OpenCV version: 3.1

(Optional)Tensorflow version: 0.12.1

- Build the source code with below command (in linux directory).
```
make
```
- Run ETS2 in windowed mode and set resolution to 1024 * 768. (It will work properly with 1920 * 1080 screen resolution and 1024 * 768 window mode ETS2)
- It cannot find the ETS2 window automatically, you should move the ETS2 window to right-down corner to fix this.
- In ETS2 Options, set controls to`Keyboard + Mouse Steering`, `left click` to acclerate, and `right click` to brake.
- Go to a highway and set truck's speed to 40~60km/h. (I recommend you turn on cruise mode to set the speed easily)
- When you want to enable the car detection mode, add an option -D or --Car_Detection.
- Run this program!
```
./ChosunTruck [-D|--Car_Detection]
```
